That’s old news to <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana Grande</a></strong> by now, but few of the singer’s past relationships have prompted the level of examination her current match-up with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethan Slater</a></strong> is currently enduring.</p><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>Much of the discourse surrounding the pair of singers’ relationship hinges on Slater’s former relationship with his high school sweetheart-turned wife, Lilly Jay, and Grande’s short-lived marriage with real estate agent Dalton Gomez. Slater and Jay have been together since 2012, married since 2018, and share a child born in 2022, while Grande married Gomez after around a year of dating in 2021. Both halves of the fresh couple <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">were still married when 2023 kicked off</a>, and the timing of their matchup is raising eyebrows, as fans wonder if their relationship began before they were truly single.</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>Regardless of the questions around that timing, Slater and Grande have been enjoying one another’s company for months now. They’ve been linked up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">since July of 2023</a>, when they first started going out in public together, but they’ve largely kept their relationship under wraps. As they shift past the six-month mark — and no news of a breakup emerges — fresh questions about their relationship are constantly emerging, down to every possible detail of their lives.</p><h2 id=h-ariana-grande-and-ethan-slater-s-heights data-injectable=false>Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater’s heights</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ariana-Grande-Ethan-Slater.jpg><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Grande and Slater haven’t been photographed together very many times, and many of the images of them together feature the pair while seated. Its an oddly specific query, but this trend is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting a common pondering</a> among fans of the pair, as they wonder after their height difference.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Grande’s height is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously hard to pin down</a>, thanks to the singer’s well-documented love of high heels. She looks a fair bit taller than she actually stands in most photos, but that’s more a result of her incredible balance and pain tolerance than her genes. The singer seems to stand, based on various altering sources, somewhere between 5 foot 1 and 5 foot 2.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=false>Slater, meanwhile, stands a good half a foot taller than his new girlfriend at around 5’7″. With her heels — which she’s rarely seen out of — in place, however, the duo likely match up perfectly. Add a few inches to Grande and she’s closer to 5’5″, just a few inches shorter than her Wicked co-star and new beau.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG6x06GYp2Wjoa61sdFmmqiloJa%2FprCMraZmmaKerq%2BtjKCpmqaUmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
