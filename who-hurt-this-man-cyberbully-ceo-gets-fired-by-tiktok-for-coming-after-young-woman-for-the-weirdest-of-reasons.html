Given the incongruousness of the comment and the fact it came from a business account, username @parchmentpaperdotcom, the TikToker assumed the account must‚Äôve been hacked and so reached out via DM to let them know. And then all hell broke loose.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@dineintoronto href=#>@dineintoronto</a><p>From any other person I would not care but to use your business account and then your title as a CEO to be rude to people you dont know is crazy. <a title=fypp href=#>#fypp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Aesthetic - Tollan Kim" href=#>‚ô¨ Aesthetic ‚Äì Tollan Kim</a></figure><p data-characters=596 data-current-count=896 data-injectable=true>After letting them know that their account had posted a ‚Äúcyberbulling‚Äù comment on her video, ParchmentPaper.com then hit back by sending dineintoronto an email. Displaying the kind of shrewd thinking that no doubt got him his high-ranking job, the email revealed that the user of the account was Brandon Howard, ParchmentPaper.com‚Äôs CEO. Their next brilliant move? Double-down on the bizarre hill they‚Äôve chosen to die on by leaving another comment on the video. ‚ÄúEnjoy frolicking through life and leave the rest up to us,‚Äù read the weaksauce attempt at sass.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>After dinintoronto shared the above video, Brandon Howard became TikTok Enemy No. 1, with the comments roasting him so badly, his highly flammable paper company is in danger of combusting. As one commenter beautifully put it, ‚ÄúBrandon Howard is quite an emotional little man.
