Well, things didn’t go exactly as planned and he ended up writing two movies that were considered big disappointments.</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>The first being <strong>Ridley Scott</strong>‘s <strong>Body of Lies</strong>, which had potential considering the director and two stars, but the end result was actually quite boring and dry. The second was action star <strong>Mel Gibson</strong>‘s return to the screen in <strong>Edge of Darkness</strong>, which didn’t amaze many people. I liked the latter a bit more because it started to pick up during the last 30 minutes, but having to sit through an otherwise boring film made the payoff barely worth it.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Now, hot off the announcement of <strong>William Monahan</strong> re-teaming with <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong> for a remake of <strong><a title="Martin Scorsese To Remake The Gambler" href=#>The Gambler</a></strong> comes news that Mr. Monahan will also be writing the sequel to <strong>Sin City</strong> for directors <strong>Robert Rodriguez</strong> and <strong>Frank Miller</strong>.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true><a title="William Monahan To Write Sin City 2" href=#>The Film Stage</a> is reporting that Monahan’s involvement with <strong>Sin City 2</strong> could mean that Rodriguez and Miller might actually want to make a serious sequel and not a quick cash grab. Rodriguez and Miller last worked together on <strong><a title="Interview With Jessica Alba On Spy Kids: All The Time In The World" href=#>Spy Kids: All the Time in the World</a></strong> and <strong>The Spirit</strong>, both universally panned by critics and audiences. <strong>The Spirit</strong> was visually pleasing but it didn’t have a gritty story to back it up like <strong>Sin City</strong>.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Shooting for <strong>Sin City 2</strong> is supposed to start later this year, which means we could see it out by the end of 2012 or early 2013. Rumors about <strong>Mickey Rourke</strong> and <strong>Jessica Alba</strong> reprising their roles have been floating around and I’m sure they won’t have a problem coming back if the script holds up or if the moneys good.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Maybe <strong>Sin City 2</strong> could be the return to height for everyone involved. Finally Monahan can write another strong script, which would lead to Rodriguez and Miller directing something good for a change, which would lead to Rourke and Alba not completely wasting their talent and starring in something engaging and hopefully unique, like the first film.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>I’d love to see the production of <strong>Sin City 2</strong> result in&nbsp;success&nbsp;for everyone involved. The fans have been waiting for what seems like forever for this thing to get off the ground and now it finally looks like it’s going somewhere!</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Check back for more information on the development of <strong>Sin City 2</strong> as we’ll be sure to keep you updated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom56okafBprCMrJqrnZWjxLO1056pZq%2BZobmqrcxmpKimkZ2ur3nWq6CtnV2otq95wqKrsmViZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
