In fact, the idea that he joined the TikTok realm is a treat to fans, as was the image he used to share his handle.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>In a nod to feeling young as he joined the app, he shared an image of himself from days gone by, and we’re feeling very Blanche Devereaux about it all. *Cue the act of fanning ourselves as we admire his beauty*</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Feeling young today…got a <a href=#>@tiktok_us</a> account. Follow me there if you’re on it too: <a href=#>https://t.co/7FiC0RSfUM</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/A2Pa81pagm</a></p>— Kevin Costner & MW (@modernwest) <a href=#>February 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>His first TikTok was a meaningful one, as he opened his Golden Globe for Actor in a Drama TV Series, and the gratitude for his win was as apparent as the passion for his craft. Costner isn’t usually a television actor, but his foray into the Dutton world so far has given us a once-in-a-lifetime kind of gift, seeing him evolving as a land owner, patriarch, and now Governor of Montana.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Of course, fans have known Costner for decades before Yellowstone, and we also know that he’s got his hands in many other projects, too. Here’s hoping we see a little bit of everything Costner’s doing when he posts more to TikTok, including his musical adventures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true><a title=@kevincostner href=#>@kevincostner</a><p>Opening a special package from the @goldenglobes for my first TikTok.

Yellowstone is often overlooked in all things mainstream media, but that’s been slowly progressing in recent months. We can only hope that the future brings more wins for a cast that’s as talented as they are fierce, fiery, and fearless.</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=false>You can keep up with Costner by following him at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@kevincostner</a> on TikTok, and don’t forget that now is the perfect time if you’ve been toying with the idea of finally watching Yellowstone, or rewatching it for the 10th time (there’s no judgment here). Paramount is having an “every episode” marathon for President’s Day weekend, and you will be able to uncover every layer of the complicated Dutton family up to this point as you theorize what’s next for them when season five returns this summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S4psLIp2Scp6Opu6a%2BjKOmoqajYsGqt9OoomavmJ65pnnRnqSippSeu6h51KxkraCRqXqpsdJmmKChnpx6rbXKnmSaZZaeu6Z51qKlnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
