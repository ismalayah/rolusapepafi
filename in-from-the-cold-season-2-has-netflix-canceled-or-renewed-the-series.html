Recommended Videos In From the Cold has one of those log lines that seem absolutely insane at first, but manages to pull off its crazy premise with brilliance. The spy drama follows a divorced mother with a deadly secret: she was once a bio-engineered Russian spy and assassin sent to infiltrate the U.S, and has the ability to shape shift to blend into her surroundings."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The spy drama follows a divorced mother with a deadly secret: she was once a bio-engineered Russian spy and assassin sent to infiltrate the U.S, and has the ability to shape shift to blend into her surroundings. As the series begins, we discover that the CIA has found out about her identity, and has given her a choice of life in prison or working for the agency.</p><p data-characters=573 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>Over eight episodes, we got the chance to see how Jenny (the spy, played excellently by Margarita Levieva) came to gain her powers, while also being led through a high octane mystery with plenty of thrills. However, fans may be asking themselves if the show will be coming back for a second season, or if it will be yet another victim of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix curse</a>, especially as season 1 ended on a bit of a cliffhanger and a revalation that blew many viewers away. If you want to know more information about In From the Cold season 2, like if it will actually exist, then read on!</p><h2 id=h-in-from-the-cold-season-2-has-netflix-canceled-or-renewed-the-series data-injectable=false>In From the Cold season 2: Has Netflix canceled or renewed the series?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=854 data-injectable=true>Fans of Jenny will be both pleased and annoyed with this answer: we’re not really sure. The showrunners have said they have everything planned out for a second season, which would see the show mostly set in New York and also dive deeper into Jenny’s backstory. Netflix, however, hasn’t confirmed either way, despite the show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting the top-10 most watched in multiple countries</a>. And, given the huge reveal at the end (that Jenny’s mother was the one behind everything), you’d imagine people are keen to get a second season.</p><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=false>Normally the streaming giant does give pretty firm information about a show if it has been cancelled, but there’s been radio silence since about In From the Cold since it dropped nearly two years ago. In this case, we might argue that no news is good news, especially as Netflix is normally so trigger happy with the cancellation button. As it is, for now In From the Cold is one of<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> many shows on the service</a> that’s in a kind of limbo, but it’s not in the worst company, with hits like Russian Doll and Master of None alongside it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yquoyfqailXam1pnnCqKOdZaOarrS7zWZpZqCRqHqvsdOfo6KwXZiur6%2FEpZydZZ%2BnerOxzZ6unpxdqbWmedKeqaKdo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
