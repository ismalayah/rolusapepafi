The performer started modeling at only 6 years old and quickly turned her attention to acting. Though she had many roles at that point, her big break came in the Disney series, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. The series starred the famous twins Dylan and Cole Sprouse as two brothers living in the Tipton Hotel suite. For her part, Song played London Tipton, the spoiled daughter of the hotel’s owner. Also starring Disney Channel star, Ashley Tisdale, the series was a jumping-off point for many actors early in their careers.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>Song has mainly stuck to television with roles in Station 19, Scandal, and Superstore. She also lends her voice to many animated projects. But it was in David Fincher’s 2010 dark biopic, The Social Network, where the actor truly played a character that was the complete opposite of her usual roles. Written by legendary wordsmith, Aaron Sorkin, and scored by Fincher’s frequent collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the film was no ordinary biopic.</p><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>Firing on all cylinders, it was a dark indictment of the creator of Facebook that gets increasingly relevant as time goes on and had Song in the substantial role of Christy, Eduardo Saverin’s (Andrew Garfield) unstable girlfriend. First meeting Eduardo when Facebook was getting off the ground, Christy’s increasing paranoia and jealousy soon put added pressure on her boyfriend, who is getting ousted from the company. Sometimes comedic and oftentimes terrifying, Song’s performance in the film was one for the books.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>Though she keeps her ventures lowkey presently, she has been part of some integral entries in pop culture, primarily Scandal, Hulu’s Dollface, and featuring in the lauded horror video game The Quarry in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmqKau6WtjKymp59doq6krdSlmLJlk6q5rLXNrGSfoZGjsKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
