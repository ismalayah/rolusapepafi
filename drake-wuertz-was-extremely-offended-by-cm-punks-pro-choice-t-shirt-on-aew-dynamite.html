On last night’s episode of AEW Dynamite, Punk was on guest commentary for the bout between AEW World Champion Adam Page and Konosuke Takeshita."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Punk was sporting a shirt with a pro-life message when he made his entrance.</p><p>Drake Wuertz took great offense to Punk’s stance in favor of reproductive health. Drake and other QAnon followers take anti-abortion activism to the extreme, often subscribing to the theory that a left-wing cabal of power brokers sexually violates, kills, and<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> drinks the blood of babies</a> to gain their essence. Drake was not a fan of Punk’s political statement, voicing his displeasure on social media.</p><p>“Liberal Athiest CM Punk promoting child sacrifice on a live Pro Wrestling show is disgraceful.</p><p>There is no “Right” to murder a baby.”</p><p>Drake Wuertz has repeatedly said that abortion is the biggest reason he is running for a legislature seat. Wuertz refers to the topic of abortion as a “medical freedom” issue. He also lumps anti-vaccination beliefs and other anti-public safety stances into the same basket.</p><p>The issue has been hotly debated recently as a leaked Supreme Court draft decision hints that the nation’s highest court intends to overturn the long-established federal right to an abortion. As a legislator, Drake Wuertz would endeavor to ban the practice completely in Florida. CM Punk believes in a woman’s right to choose.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
