Or, at the very least, they certainly don’t hurt.</p><p data-characters=555 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>As avid readers of Sarah J. Maas know, the author likes to sprinkle bonus chapters into her works. Those who have already dived into A Court of Thorns and Roses have surely stumbled upon them, and the same can be said about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Throne of Glass</a> or Crescent City fans. If you’ll recall, the first book in this series, House of Earth and Blood, had no bonus chapters to be found, however, the second installment treated readers to three. Given this, it’s natural for people to wonder whether or not the third book has some surprises before buying it.</p><h2 id=h-does-house-of-flame-and-shadow-have-bonus-chapters data-injectable=false>Does House of Flame and Shadow have bonus chapters?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/crescent-city-books.jpg><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>Yes, House of Flame and Shadow has bonus chapters, much like House of Sky and Breath. In fact, it has five of them, as five different special editions have been published. Just from looking at one of the books you won’t be able to tell which edition it is, though, as all of them look exactly the same on the outside — the only things distinguishing them are the bonus chapters within and the place where you buy them.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>This is to say that depending on where you purchase your copy, you’ll get a specific bonus chapter. Thus, it’s best that you know exactly which chapter you’d rather read before heading to a random bookstore, lest you end up disappointed. For your convenience, here is a list of the five bonus chapters in House of Flame and Shadow, and information on where to acquire each one:</p><ul data-current-count=1464 data-injectable=true><li>Walmart — Bryce, Azriel, and Nesta bonus chapter, in which they talk about their different worlds.</li><li>Target — Lidia and Ruhn bonus chapter, in which Ruhn gets a happy surprise.</li><li>Books-A-Million and Indigo — Ember and Randall bonus chapter, diving into what happens after the two are sent to Prythian by Bryce.</li><li>Independent bookstores — Bryce and Danika bonus chapter, telling the story of how Bryce got the horn tattoo on her back.</li><li>Barnes & Noble and Waterstones — Bryce and Hunt bonus chapter, in which the two pay a visit to Bryce’s parents and talk about the future.</li></ul><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>If you’re interested in reading all of these, do feel free to step inside all the establishments listed.
