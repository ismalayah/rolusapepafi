However, at least for her, it wasn’t all fun and games prior to that, while shooting the exteriors in Greece, where the pool scene took place.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>“There’s Birdie,” Hudson laughed, as the chat show cut to her character’s flowy, dramatic entrance. “While everyone else was having Aperol Spritzes in Greece, I was just waiting for that scene to be shot so I could just join everybody.”</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>“Everybody was having a great time.

She previously opened up about attending the premiere with her mother Goldie Hawn, who is also comedy royalty, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">getting to see her reaction</a> while watching the film on the big screen for the first time.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>“Especially this movie, it’s so comedic, and I knew she would love it,” she told Seth Meyers earlier this month. “She was far more excited to see Edward [Norton] after the movie than me. I was like, ‘Mom, what, mom? Mom?’ She was like ‘Edward.’ But she loved it.”</p><p data-characters=95 data-current-count=95 data-injectable=false>And Edward Norton didn’t even have to make any sacrifices while filming, that we know of!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoopqslWK1trDSqKVmmZyYvKm7y2aepZmjqHqwusiopWaZXaC7qsLErGSoraRiwLW70bJkm6GbnruqedKcnKedXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
