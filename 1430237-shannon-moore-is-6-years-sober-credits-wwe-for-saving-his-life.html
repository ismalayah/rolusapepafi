Unfortunately, Moore went down a dark path and became an addict.</p><p><a href=#>Moore</a> spoke with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tampa Bay Times</a> about his addictions and how he fought through them. Moore now works as a counselor at Riverside Recovery of Tampa and shared his story.</p><p>He felt like he needed all the drugs to help him have the strength and stamina to work as a wrestler. He initially used painkillers, but later became addicted to heroin. This also led to money issues and divorce, and a scary incident that led him to get sober.</p><p>“I thought, in order to keep going at the caliber of an athlete that I am, I’m going to take this stuff… That’s all that mattered. Wrestling came first. Everything else was second,” Moore said.</p><p>“The first thing an addict does is start blaming people,” he added. “So, for me, there was a lot of resentment and blame, putting everything on my ex-wife. It was all my fault. I just wasn’t taking ownership [of the situation and my addiction].”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>A cry for help</h2><p>One day, Moore packed a bag with guns and heroin and planned to drive from North Carolina to Florida to kill his ex-wife, before killing himself or going to jail. Moore ultimately called WWE’s “Road Dogg” Brian James, who ultimately helped get him into WWE-sponsored rehab.</p><p>“I said, ‘Hey, dude, you’re probably going to hear about me on the news. Something bad is going to happen. He reached back out, and the rest is history,” Shannon Moore said.</p><p>Moore mentioned that WWE was the main reason for him to overcome addiction.</p><p>“Then I had one last desperate cry for help. The WWE saved my life,” Moore said.</p><p>He shared that he went down that tragic path because he had a lot of money and a lot of free time. After his IMPACT Wrestling run ended, Moore took a hiatus from wrestling.</p><p>“That was the worst thing I ever did. I was sitting at home, I had time. I had money. And what do you do? You just party. I think that’s the point where physical addiction set in. I was 13, 14, 15, 16, pretty much partying with these pro wrestlers… It was sex, drugs, and rock and roll for me.”</p><h2 id=h-shannon-moore-is-now-counseling-addicts-in-tampa-florida>Shannon Moore is now counseling addicts in Tampa, Florida</h2><p>Now, Moore is helping other addicts escape that dark hole.</p><p>“I never had any interest in working in this industry. When I went in treatment, I’m like, ‘Man, this is pretty amazing. People are getting a second chance.’ A lot of wrestlers are scared to ask for help. They think it will label them as black sheep. I’m proof it won’t.”</p><p>Moore is now trying his best to help others.</p><p>“There have been plenty of offers,” Moore said about a possible return to wrestling on a larger scale. “But Riverside has an amazing team. I believe in what we are doing. I’ve got a taste of being in service. My whole thing now is just trying to do my part and hopefully use my platform and use my career to hopefully help somebody.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsZ2trZ2LAqa3Np6anZZ2kvLOxjKKqZm5drrKivtJmqqialad6pL7EnaCtq12sxKZ5xaipZquRq7avs4yhoKxlnJ6zpg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
