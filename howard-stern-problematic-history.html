During his reign as a leading radio personality in the '90s, he marketed himself as a Hollywood outsider who hated everyone in the system and wouldn't bat an eyelash slinging insults at whatever he fancied. "I fart on the air," he used to say. Along with his co-hosts, he also had segments for the sole purpose of degrading women, asking them to strip or hop on weighing scales or even flinging meat to their behinds. He didn't care who he offended because he meant to offend.</p><p>"The way that I felt that I could get mass audiences and ensure I'd get to work another day was to be the most outlandish, the most wild, the most funny and controversial, like a guy who had just gotten out of an insane asylum," he explained to <a href=#>The New York Times Magazine</a>. "I was unleashing parts of my brain that I probably should've kept quiet, but I felt it was a legitimate way to do radio."&nbsp;His insistence on being the most outrageous and controversial for sustained attention often led him to take things too far. He joked about masturbating to a photo of Aunt Jemima, mocked Selena's death a day before her funeral, and made light of the Columbine High School shooting. He didn't care as long as it earned him listeners, and the most shocking part is that he has no regrets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmaoB2hY6hprCZopl6tMDEq6VmqKKkr62xzJqroptdnba0wM6rsGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
