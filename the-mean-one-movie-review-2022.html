This past October, many horror hounds learned about the actor's&nbsp;freaky, flesh-carving, and playful&nbsp;character Art&nbsp;the Clown in Damien Leone's&nbsp;"Terrifier 2." Here, he brings his macabre sense of humor to "The Mean One," wearing a green costume inspired by&nbsp;<a href=#>Jim Carrey</a> and Ron Howard's 2000 take on the character, with the same sharp pug nose and deep folds on his face.&nbsp;"Terrifier 2" may be why "The Mean One" is getting a wider theatrical release this month than something like "The Gingerdead Man" ever did, but it's at this movie's peril.</p><p>Written by Finn & <a href=#>Flip Kobler</a> (with a story credit for director <a href=#>Steven LaMorte</a>),&nbsp;"The Mean One" reimagines<span class=s1>&nbsp;the Grinch with the fire of hell in his eyes.&nbsp;</span>Instead of just stealing from Whoville, he&nbsp;terrorizes the town of Newville, unleashing his deep hatred of Christmas on anyone who promotes it. Carry a box of gifts with a bow&nbsp;on top? You'll be instantly cut in half as if you were in "<a href=#>A Quiet Place</a>" (and that is inferred here, in an amusing beat, with visual innuendo). Go hiking up on the&nbsp;mountains where the Mean One toils? You'll go missing.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;And when&nbsp;drunken Santacon attendees roll into a restaurant, he unleashes a murder royale. But watching the Mean One kill people with candy canes should be more amusing than it is here.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Instead of adding to what little&nbsp;fun&nbsp;"The Mean One" can offer, the movie's handling of Thornton only magnifies how it's too incomprehensible to deliver its central&nbsp;joke. "The Mean One" cuts corners until there's hardly anything&nbsp;left—it's designed to hide him behind shaky camera scenes of violence and overly&nbsp;dark lighting. Worst of all, the movie's&nbsp;commitment to&nbsp;CGI blood splatters zaps the basic thrills of scenes where the&nbsp;Grinch is presented as a natural-born&nbsp;killer.&nbsp;</p><p>Burdened with having to fill a feature's length&nbsp;out of this bloody riff, the movie makes the mistake of thinking we'll indulge in even&nbsp;the slightest emotional investment in Cindy You-Know-Who (<a href=#>Krystle Martin</a>), whose parents have been murdered by The Mean One. Cindy's inner journey, returning to Newville after 20 years when her mom was killed,&nbsp;is about revenge, battling the triggers that come from looking at a fireplace, and a sense that she might be able to forgive herself if she hunts The&nbsp;Mean One down. A Newville cop (<a href=#>Chase Mullins</a>) and the town's local kook (<a href=#>John Bigham</a>) assist Cindy with her mission and establish&nbsp;The Mean One as a Michael Myers-like menace. As one can predict, all of these characters&nbsp;are just&nbsp;walking tropes that kill time, flattening the movie in the process.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lnZqur3nOp5xmpZ%2BrtqZ50Z6top2nYn9xfpE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
