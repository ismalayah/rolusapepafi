First of all, it turns out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor: Love and Thunder</a> isn’t going to get any wiser with age as its anniversary has been spent suffering its worst humiliation yet. Elsewhere, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brie Larson</a>‘s The Marvels fails to earn an accolade you’d think would be an easy win, thanks to some unexpectedly strong competition. Last but not least, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a> is up to its old tricks as it emerges on a new platform.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-the-marvels-fails-to-be-named-the-best-marvel-project-still-to-come-in-2023-thanks-to-tom-hiddleston data-injectable=false>‘The Marvels’ fails to be named the best Marvel project still to come in 2023, thanks to Tom Hiddleston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Loki-in-Loki.jpg><p data-characters=622 data-current-count=922 data-injectable=true>Although you might think The Marvels hype would be peaking right now, amid Secret Invasion dropping new episodes weekly and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a second trailer due sometime soon</a>, it turns out that Loki season two remains <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most highly anticipated Marvel project still to come this year</a>, despite this being the sequel to a $1 billion blockbuster we’re talking about. But then perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising given that 2019’s Captain Marvel has been <a href=#>scientifically proven to be the MCU’s most hated movie</a>. Not that any of this is bothering Brie Larson, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s currently living her best life at Disneyland</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Thor: Love and Thunder receives its most embarrassing blow yet by being torn apart on its first birthday</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Thor-Love-and-Thunder.png><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=933 data-injectable=true>For those who don’t live in the U.K. or any other countries where the tradition reigns, birthday bumps are a round of light-hearted physical abuse given to someone on their birthday “for luck.” Well, by that logic, Thor: Love and Thunder is the luckiest Marvel film of them all as it’s been dished out its fair share of birthday bumps today to mark one year exactly since it theatrical debut. If you thought this one’s reputation would improve with age, then you were very much mistaken as 12 months going by has only convinced its haters that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s pretty much the worst MCU offering of them all</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 releases on digital to the sound of wailing Marvel fans everywhere</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-21.jpg><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=true>In other news, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be knocking on Disney Plus’ door for a while yet</a>, but it is now yours to rent or purchase on digital. Thankfully, unlike certain other MCU releases of late, its arrival on VOD doesn’t seem to be hurting its standing within the fan community as James Gunn’s Marvel farewell is proving to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just as emotionally devastating in our living rooms</a> as it was in the theater. So if you’re looking to spend your weekend sobbing on your couch as your heart is ripped out at least 15 times, then you know what you need to watch.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">home to the most tragic collection of characters in cinema</a>, but the real tragedy would be if you missed the next batch of Marvel updates, so don’t go anywhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbrnAq62epF2jsri%2FjJupop1doa6zv86nZKWno5rAbq3NZpilpF2eurG70a2Yp6xdrLavedOoZKWnm556or%2BMrZ%2Boql2hvLexjJqlnWWkncKvsMSrZKytlpuys7%2BMoqusZZensqLAxKyrZqClorattcCtoKimXa6ytXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
