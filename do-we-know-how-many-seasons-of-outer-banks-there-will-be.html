However, Netflix has been making some bold — and honestly puzzling — decisions lately, bringing down the axe on even the better half of its shows. It’s no wonder that adventure aficionados are wondering how many seasons Outer Banks will have.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/outer-banks-season-3-release-date-and-cast.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/outer-banks-season-3-netflix-john-b-and-big-john.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/outer-banks-season-3-netflix.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/outer-banks-season-3-is-now-filming.png><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately for expectant fans, there is no telling how long Outer Banks will run. Unless season three wraps up the story, which is highly unlikely given how much there is left to unpack, we predict that the series can go on for at least another season, possibly even more. This is merely speculation, however, and it’s worth noting that there is no word about a fourth season just yet.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>“Ever since we started, we always viewed it as something that was probably like a four-season, maybe five-season show, but definitely four seasons,” showrunner Jonas Pate told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “We’ve sort of long-arced it out pretty far. I’m just hoping that we get a chance to actually tell those stories.” Clearly, if it was up to Pate, Outer Banks fans would have nothing to worry about, but in Netflix’s hands, no show is safe.</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=85 data-injectable=false>Outer Banks will be available for streaming exclusively on Netflix, starting Feb. 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu4ywnGajnqTEbrTOsGSmmZ6uerSxwKymp6tdpLNuu9StnKtlkpa7rL%2BMrZ%2BeqpVixKq4y2aZnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
