Kanye West has announced that rapper <a href=#><strong>Tyga</strong></a> will be the newest addition to the GOOD Music crew, joining a roster that includes Pusha T, Big Sean, Desiigner and more.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>The announcement came during last night’s GOOD Music pop-up show at the Highline Ballroom in New York City, which acted as a re-do of Kanye’s cancelled pop-up show that he planned to have at NYC’s Webster Hall back in June. The show, which featured appearances from the GOOD squad, was about as nuts as you’d think, especially considering Teyana Taylor, the star of Kanye’s “Fade” music video, came out to do a re-creation of the dance from it.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>However, the Tyga signing was one of the biggest events of the night, and it got mixed reactions across the Internet. What sticks out the most is the obvious family connection between Tyga and Kanye West in the first place: Tyga dates Kanye’s sister-in-law Kylie Jenner. Was the signing just because family get-togethers would have just been too awkward? Would it be even more awkward now if Tyga and Jenner break up? So much awkwardness, so little time.</p><p data-characters=760 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>There is, however, the possibility that Kanye actually believes in the guy and thinks he can churn out quality material. Tyga’s only released four solo records through his near-ten year career, and it’s had its ups and downs. His biggest hit thus far came in the form of the top ten charting track, “Rack City,” but arguably his strongest work was his first: his debut album, No Introduction. No Introduction was released back in 2008 on Decaydance, the label owned by Fall Out Boy’s Pete Wentz, and it had a huge pop sound to it that Tyga managed to master. Though no song from it took off like it should have, if Kanye makes the executive decision to have him move back to hip-pop, then we could potentially see Tyga a lot more than we are already.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>With the addition of <strong>Tyga</strong> to GOOD Music, you can probably expect him in some fashion on Kanye’s upcoming GOOD compilation, Cruel Winter, which is planned for release early next year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46kmKexlWLEpr%2FTZqqin56oerXFxppkoKefmXquwdKimmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
