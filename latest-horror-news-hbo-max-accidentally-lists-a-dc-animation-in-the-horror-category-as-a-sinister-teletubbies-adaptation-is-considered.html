Over the last 24 hours or so, a hilarious HBO Max error has labeled a DC animation as a horror movie while a live-action Teletubbies adaptation could have a spooky foundation.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>So, before you run out and purchase early tickets for Cocaine Bear, follow along as we explore the latest updates in the horror realm.</p><h2 id=h-hbo-max-fumbles-by-hailing-a-dc-animation-as-a-horror-feature data-injectable=false>HBO Max fumbles by hailing a DC animation as a horror feature</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dc-league-super-pets-superman.jpg><p data-characters=626 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>It’s common knowledge that the majority of people have made their fair share of mistakes in life, and as it turns out, HBO Max is no different from the rest of us. Most recently, it has been discovered that the streaming service has DC League of Super-Pets listed under the horror category — and for those of you that know the movie well, then you know <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s the farthest thing from a horror movie</a>. On the other hand, a handful of parents have argued that the movie boasts content that is far too scary for children, but to group it in the same category with films in The Conjuring universe feels a bit too over dramatic.</p><h2 id=h-maybe-winnie-the-pooh-blood-and-honey-isn-t-so-bad-after-all data-injectable=false>Maybe Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey isn’t so bad after all</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/winnie-the-pooh-slasher.jpg><p data-characters=639 data-current-count=939 data-injectable=true>Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, the latest online viral sensation, is currently sweeping the horror community and enjoying a fair run at the U.S. box office. With that being said, the self-proclaimed creature feature has received an unhealthy amount of horrid reviews — with plenty of folks describing the film as a “pointless” project that didn’t really need to be made. And yet, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie’s redeeming quality just might be enough</a> to save its reputation. One of the biggest criticisms that folks have pointed out is lazy storytelling, and there’s been a suggestion to create a sequel that is deeply disturbing and dark.</p><h2 id=h-an-eye-opening-teletubbies-horror-tale-was-not-on-our-bingo-card data-injectable=false>An eye-opening Teletubbies horror tale was not on our bingo card</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/teletubbies.jpg><p data-characters=626 data-current-count=926 data-injectable=true>Let’s be honest, the Teletubbies are frightening enough on their own — but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a potential horror film surrounding the memorable characters</a> could make them even more terrifying. As revealed by Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey director Rhys Waterfield, a new slasher extravaganza involving children’s characters could be on the way. The filmmaker himself expressed an interest in creating the movie, and horror fans are understandably perplexed on how to feel about the entire thing. Then again, the horror genre is synonymous with taking risks and creating original pieces, so maybe this isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds.</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=79 data-injectable=false>Slither back here tomorrow, gorehounds, for another fresh-faced horror roundup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbrTOq6moql2jsri%2FjKGZqGWdlsVurcKcoJ2dnqmurbjYZqOiq6SoeqJ5w5xkmqaZoq61tc6nZKKmXam1pnnHqKmrp6JisKLAxKCmq7FdlsBurYysoKeho6mys3nTnqOerKWXr6qx0maYnZmgqa61tc6nZKKrXZi8r7%2FInZyrnZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
