Despite the success of the first, <strong><a href=#>Mindy Kaling</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Bill Hader</a></strong> won’t be signing on for the sequel.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-why-won-t-bill-hader-and-mindy-kaling-be-in-inside-out-2 data-injectable=false>Why won’t Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling be in Inside Out 2?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=631 data-current-count=931 data-injectable=true>There is no denying that Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling perfectly embodied their Inside Out emotions. Hader, who plays Fear in the film, has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">very open about his own struggles with anxiety</a>. The comedian had a panic attack <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during a live SNL skit</a> – though you’d never even know it. Mindy Kaling is just as perfect for Disgust. Her work on The Mindy Project and the Office helped establish the snooty persona perfect for the character. While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the creators went back and forth</a> on whether Disgust “should be disgusted or disgusting” for some time, they knew Kaling was the perfect person to voice a perpetually disgusted person.</p><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Despite the spot on casting, Kaling revealed back in January 2023 that she wasn’t coming back for the sequel. At the time, she told The Wrap that, while she wasn’t a part of the production at that very moment, there could have been a different outcome. At the time, there was speculation that her hesitancy might have been due to salary disputes. It seems those rumors have been confirmed. The <a href=#>Puck</a> Newsletter broke news that the actors were offered just 2% of the salary Amy Poehler received. Where the Joy actress was set to rake in $5 million, Hader and Kaling were each offered only $100K.</p><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>On top of that, Poehler was offered “addition fees and bonuses,” where her co-stars were not. With the duo giving the film a hard pass, the roles have been passed on to some different but equally talented actors. Liza Lapira (Fast & Furious)&nbsp;is the new Disgust, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hale </a>(Arrested Development) is stepping in for Fear. In addition to the familiar cast of characters, the movie is set to introduce everyone’s least favorite part of middle school: ever-looming social anxiety. Anxiety will be voice by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maya Hawke</a> (Stranger Things).</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>With the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sag-Aftra strikes finally coming to a close</a> earlier this week, we hope that this sort of discrepancy is a thing of the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeUnsCvsdhorqGxXayys7GMm6ClpF2drqWx0WaYp5xdoravsNhmopqkmaO0br7EnJisrF2bvLN5yKeqopyVYry2wIxrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
