Recommended Videos The first season of Chainsaw Man came to an end in late 2022 after only 12 short episodes, but that was more than enough to leave an impression on the anime community. Throughout its run, viewers had to constantly worry about the safety of their favorite characters, and not even Aki was safe. In fact, his fate seems to be in particular danger, in comparison to other Devil Hunters."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Throughout its run, viewers had to constantly worry about the safety of their favorite characters, and not even Aki was safe. In fact, his fate seems to be in particular danger, in comparison to other Devil Hunters.</p><p data-characters=641 data-current-count=1024 data-injectable=true>At the beginning of episode 11, viewers are introduced to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Devil</a>, who explains to Aki that it needs to see his future before offering him a contract. When the hunter sticks his head into the creature’s belly, it claims that Aki will die horribly, but is cut off before revealing how that will go down. To make matters worse, at the very end of the episode, while Aki faces off against the Ghost Devil, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Akane</a> orders it to strangle him to death. The episode quickly ends with the hunter’s eyes closing, leaving viewers to ponder if they’re truly about to witness Aki’s demise, as foretold by the Future Devil.</p><p data-characters=28 data-current-count=28 data-injectable=false><strong>Warning: Spoilers to follow.</strong></p><h2 data-injectable=false>Does Aki die in the Chainsaw Man anime?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Chainsaw-man-Finale-Aki.jpg><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>To the disappointment of many fans, Aki does indeed die in Chainsaw Man. Although he survives throughout season one of the anime, death will come for him eventually, as it did in the manga. In this universe, though, dying of strangulation at the hands of the Ghost Devil doesn’t top the list of worst or most painful ways to go, which is enough to tell us that this ain’t it. Fate has something far more brutal in store for Aki.</p><h2 id=h-how-does-aki-die-in-chainsaw-man data-injectable=false>How does Aki die in Chainsaw Man?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chainsaw-man-aki.jpg><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>Eventually, Aki’s obsession with hunting down the Gun Devil has to lead somewhere. And oh boy, it does. During the Devil’s first appearance in-universe, it completely annihilated millions of people around the world, with Aki’s family being among the victims. Years later, the Gun Devil is summoned once again and makes an attack on a Japanese town, targeting Makima. In order to protect her, Aki ends up being killed by the very being he swore vengeance on.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>As if that wasn’t enough, the Devil then possesses Aki’s corpse, turning him into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gun Fiend</a>. While controlled by the creature he most despises, Aki attacks Denji and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Power</a>, his closest friends, whom he has taken care of since the start of the series. With no other alternative to defend himself, Denji engages the Gun Fiend in battle.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Does Denji kill Aki in Chainsaw Man?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/denji-csm-e1692006409625.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/makima-chainsaw-man-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Himeno-Chainsaw-Man.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Aki-Chainsaw-Man.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/power-chainsaw-man3-1.jpg><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=891 data-injectable=true>While facing off against Denji, Aki’s consciousness recalls the last memory he had before his family’s murder. The hunter remembers having a snowball fight with his younger brother, but this time, he envisions Denji in the place of his brother and later imagines him crying. This speaks to how much Denji grows on Aki after their first encounter, and it’s what ultimately weakens his will to fight. Seeing no other way out of the situation, the Chainsaw Man ultimately kills the Gun Fiend, causing Aki to die a second time.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>In a universe with so much death, few people have it as tough as Aki. Nevertheless, Chainsaw Man‘s story moves forward, reaching new heights of success every day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6dpp6rXZa4qnnDopxmoZ5isKmtyKeqmq9doq6vew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
