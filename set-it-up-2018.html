Harper wants to be a writer but can't muster the nerve to follow through on her one good idea; on top of that, her days are so long than whenever she does try to write, she's so tired that "everything I&nbsp;write is, like, bad." Charlie (Glen&nbsp;Powell)&nbsp;is an assistant to Rick (<a href=#>Taye Diggs</a>), a <a href=#>Tom Wolfe</a> Master-of-the-Universe type whose job never quite comes into focus but definitely involves huge sums of money.</p><p>The bosses' employers are located in the same building, which allows Charlie and&nbsp;Harper to meet cute in the lobby one late night. Harper orders food for her boss without realizing the restaurant is cash-only. Charlie, who just missed the cutoff to order his boss' favorite steak, spots an opportunity to redeem himself,&nbsp;pays for the order, and claims the whole thing; this&nbsp;leads to a charming negotiation that splits up the food, and ultimately to a shared realization that if they can trick their Type A bosses into falling in love, they might get their lives back. "It's hard to bark orders at someone when your tongue is down someone's throat,"&nbsp;Harper says.&nbsp;</p><p>Harper just signed up for Tinder and is going out on lots of&nbsp;dates, and&nbsp;Charlie is devoted to a gorgeous but materialistic&nbsp;girlfriend (<a href=#>Joan Smalls</a>) who doesn't appreciate him. But the two spend so much time together plotting their bosses' romance that they become&nbsp;close friends, and there are moments where they click so well that you can sense them laboring to deny the obvious. Director&nbsp;<a href=#>Claire Scanlon</a> and screenwriter <a href=#>Katie Silberman</a> are able to imagine these two as&nbsp;both credible&nbsp;human beings&nbsp;and classic romantic comedy&nbsp;types (Charlie is young <a href=#>Jack Lemmon</a> poured into&nbsp;a tall preppy frame, while Deutch can remind you of either <a href=#>Ellen Page</a> or <a href=#>Diane Keaton</a>, depending on&nbsp;the scene and how fast she's talking).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46snK1lmal6tryMa2dqcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
