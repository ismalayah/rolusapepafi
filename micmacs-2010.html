Recall his magical “<a href=#>Amelie</a>” (2001) and “<a href=#>A Very Long Engagement</a>” (2004), and you'll understand its fancies. Recall his “<a href=#>City Of Lost Children</a>” (1995), and you'll understand its problems. In an age when special effects can show us almost anything, there can come a tipping point when a movie is essentially only showing off. I'm not flatly against that, but in general, I like to delude myself that the story is in the foreground. It's a judgment call. You may enjoy “Micmacs” more than I did.</p><p>The story is about a sad-sack video store clerk named Bazil (<a href=#>Dany Boon</a>). His father was killed by a land mine. As a child, opening a box of his father's effects, he finds the trademark of the land mine's manufacturer. Bazil grows up into a feckless young man who passes his time in the video store by reciting the dialogue of movies in sync with the playback. One day, after a series of shall we say improbable events, he's shot in the forehead. The doc flips a coin and decides to leave in the bullet (which was made by the same manufacturer as the land mine), even though Bazil could die at any moment.</p><p>Naturally, he's replaced at work. He's taken under the wing of a band of scavengers who live in a sort of Aladdin's Cave inside a mound of junk. This may sound sordid, but it's not. Imagine Steampunk Heaven. These people have the resources of a troupe of itinerant troubadours. They could start their own circus.</p><p>There's the contortionist named Elastic Girl (<a href=#>Julie Ferrier</a>). The Guinness Book obsessed-type named Buster (<a href=#>Dominique Pinon</a>). A master thief named Slammer (Jean-Pierre Marielle), perhaps because of where he's spent a lot of time. A woman, Calculator (Marie-Julie Baup), whose mind does mathematical wonders. A sage from the Congo (<a href=#>Omar Sy</a>) who speaks in Fortune Cookie. And Mama Chow (<a href=#>Yolande Moreau</a>), who feeds and mothers them. Oh, and a human cannonball.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46moJylkZjAbn6Pamc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
