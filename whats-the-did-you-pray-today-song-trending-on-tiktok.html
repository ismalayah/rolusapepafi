Even if it wasn’t spawned by a frequent TikToker — like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax’s “Victoria’s Secret”</a> — the site has increasingly become the testing grounds for fresh bangers. Even older songs return to prominence following a detour through TikTok, which — paired with relevant pop culture resurgences — breathed new life into releases like “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God),” “Dreams,” and “Potential Breakup Song” through the early 2020s.</p><p data-characters=601 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>New music can also find a foothold through the app, as can slightly older —&nbsp;but not decades old — favorites. When a new track rises on the app, it typically litters hundreds of thousands of separate videos, all but ensuring that most viewers will stumble across it eventually. Unfortunately, it’s not always clear what the song is that accompanies a video, which leaves some users fruitlessly searching the web in vain. We’ve got answers for those curious web-users seeking out information on one of TikTok’s latest bangers, which has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">single line on constant repeat </a>in our heads.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-song-in-tiktok-s-did-you-pray-today-trend data-injectable=false>What is the song in TikTok’s ‘did you pray today’ trend?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>The same line keeps cropping up in TikTok videos, as aggressive base and a single voice demand to know “did you pray today?”</p><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>The line is from Young Thug’s 2016 track “Gangster Sh*t.” The trend leans on a few lines from the song’s earliest moments, which simply see the rapper repeat “did you pray today” and variations of “I could put you down on some gangster sh*t” several times. The remainder of the song is largely absent from TikTok videos, and the version that is most commonly used appears to be distorted. Videos participating in the trend usually sound like they’ve blown a speaker out, and Young Thug’s original is much less jarring.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is the ‘did you pray today’ trend?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@mikeogunpehin href=#>@mikeogunpehin</a><p>Replying to @juju🪼 <a title=didyoupraytoday href=#>#didyoupraytoday</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=trend href=#>#trend</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=foryourpage href=#>#foryourpage</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=viralvideo href=#>#viralvideo</a> <a title=jeo4ns href=#>#jeo4ns</a> <a title=enricopucci href=#>#enricopucci</a></p><a title="♬ Gangsta Shyt - user18647354906" href=#>♬ Gangsta Shyt – user18647354906</a></figure><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>Videos participating in TikTok’s “did you pray today” trend are pretty diverse, but many rely on the same components. To be fair, its not so much a trend as an oft-used song, which is largely the culprit behind its tag page’s diversity. Still, quite a few people enjoy the audio clip in the same context: with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their hands pressed together</a>, as if in prayer, and dancing along to the beat, or responding to a caption about various scenarios — like checking your bank account — that might require a quick prayer.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>There are quite a few animal videos accompanying the trend, as well, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as cats</a> — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in particular</a> — appearing to engage in prayer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dominate</a> the relevant hashtag’s most popular section.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=false>There’s also a subsection of the trend that appears to use the song as a compliment of sorts. Videos leaning on this translation of the trend largely feature particularly attractive or appealing women, and seem to lean into the “prayer” portion of the song in a much <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thirstier context</a>. The implication appears to be that, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after witnessing these women</a>, viewers will need a prayer or two to cleanse their filthy souls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTArapmrJiaeqW1w2awqK1dpb%2BixYytpp2ZqWLAsLrGZqurnZ6Ztq%2BzjKilZqyZoMGwt44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
