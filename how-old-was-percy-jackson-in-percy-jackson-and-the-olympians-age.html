The book introduces Jackson as a troubled boy who has been expelled from every school he has ever attended. He meets the satyr Grover Underwood in disguise at Yancy Academy before he is taken to Camp Half-Blood, where the real story kicks off.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>It is established that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackson was born on Aug. 18th, 1993</a>, which places his age at a tender 12 years when&nbsp;The Lightning Thief&nbsp;was first unveiled to eager readers in 2005. Throughout the series, we witness Jackson’s personality evolve, much like the sea’s ebb and flow, as he matures and gains confidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Percy-Jackson-art.jpg><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=758 data-injectable=true>Jackson’s authentic portrayal includes initial hurdles with dyslexia and ADHD, making him an incredibly approachable and inspirational figure for many young readers. In “The Sea of Monsters”&nbsp;(2007), the sequel to&nbsp;The Lightning Thief, Percy Jackson reaches the age of thirteen while the plot develops. The clever alignment of his age with the release date of each book allows us to calculate Jackson’s age in each installment easily.</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=false>Towards the end of&nbsp;The Last Olympian, the fifth and latest book in the series, Percy Jackson turns 16.
