(This has to be one of the most hilariously morbid ways to begin a series.)</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Yusuke’s selfless act catches the spirit world off guard. He was known to be a bad egg so. So, when his pointless sacrifice is taken into account, everyone in the afterlife is initially confused regarding what to do with the 14-year-old. The character eventually agrees to be resurrected after seeing the pain his death has caused to those around him, especially his mother.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>However, when he is brought back, he is imbued with new abilities, such as being able to spot demons possessing everyday people. And thus, Yusuke’s story arc begins as he becomes Earth’s personal defender, its Spirit Detective.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Throughout Yu Yu Hakusho, fans get to see the character tangle with demons, former Spirit Detectives gone rogue, and psychic children who are downright crazy (not in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Shining</a> kind of way, but more in the “I really love video games kind of way”). And that doesn’t even scratch the surface.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Yusuke’s journey of becoming a brash hooligan to an eventual guardian against supernatural threats propelled his character forward into anime and manga legend territory.
