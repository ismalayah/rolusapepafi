Then Rollins promptly beat Murphy down at ringside. He smashed his disciple against the barricade because Murphy failed him during the match.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>As Seth Rollins was leaving, he made a comment to Mysterio’s wife that he hopes “she turns out better than your son,” while referring to Aalyah. Murphy remained beaten down by the stairs as Rey’s wife and daughter got in the ring.</p><p>As Aalyah passed Murphy, she knelt down and put her hand on his arm. This was a sympathetic gesture that was caught by tons of fans. Everything happens in WWE for a reason, at least to tease a possible direction.</p><p>It seems that a romantic angle could be brewing. The foreshadowing is quite evident that Aalyah was brought onto television for a much bigger reason.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>September 14, 2020 10:18 pm</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9xe49yZmpsX6zEpnnTnpisnaNiv7C5wKeanmWRo7StsYywoK2gXaeyunnMsqqtnaKevLR5w5qsoKCkmr9urcClsJqgXaS7br7AsGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
